/**
 * There is a lot of functionality related with managing the "map" for the world (the look of the terrain, and whether or not it is traversable). 
 * It would make sense to group this functionality out into a separate class. 
 * The map can manage the rendering of the terrain, and allow functionality for checking whether a particular location on the map is traversable or not. 
 * It would also make sense for the map to hold the dimensions of the map / world.
